# Signals and Systems Project - winter 2021 CE & IT Dept

In this project there are some questions which we should define and calculate some functions or expressions.

Used matplotlib to show the functions and figures.

Jupyter Note Book was a very good choice to describe and solve the problems so we used it in this project.
